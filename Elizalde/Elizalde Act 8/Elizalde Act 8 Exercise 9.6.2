9.6.2 Java Scavenger Hunt
Now let's start the search!
1. Look for a method that checks if a certain String ends with a certain suffix. For
example, if the given string is "Hello", the method should return true the suffix given
is "lo", and false if the given suffix is "alp".

Class: String
Method Declaration:
public boolean endsWith(String suffix)

Sample Usage:
String myStr = "Hello";
System.out.println(myStr.endsWith("lo"));


2. Look for the method that determines the character representation for a specific digit
in the specified radix. For example, if the input digit is 15, and the radix is 16, the
method would return the character F, since F is the hexadecimal representation for
the number 15 (base 10).

Class: Character
Method Declaration:
public static char forDigit(int digit, int radix)  
Sample Usage:
char myChar = Character.forDigit(15, 16);
System.out.println(myChar);

3. Look for the method that terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine

Class: Runtime
Method Declaration:
public void halt(int status)
Sample Usage:
System.out.println("Program starting...");
Runtime.getRuntime().halt(0);
System.out.println("Process is still running.");

4. Look for the method that gets the floor of a double value. For example, if I input a 3.13, the method should return the value 3.

Class: Math
Method Declaration:
public static double floor(double d)
Sample Usage:
double d = 3.13;
System.out.println(Math.floor(d));

5. Look for the method that determines if a certain character is a digit. For example, if I
input '3', it returns the value true.

Class: Character
Method Declaration:
public static boolean isDigit(int codePoint)
Sample Usage:
int codepoint = 3;
boolean check = Character.isDigit(codepoint);
System.out.println(check);
