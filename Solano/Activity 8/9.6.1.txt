1. Class - Classes are templates to create objects used in object-oriented programming.
2. Object - An object is a particular class instance; instead of variable, it contains real value.
3. Instantiate - Instantiate in Java means to call the constructor of a class that generates
		 an instance or object of the type of class.
4. Instance Variable - Instance variables are specified within a class, but outside of any method,
		       so they are global in scope for any class instance.
5. Instance Method - Instance method are methods which will need an object of its class to be
		     created before it can be called.
6. Class Variables or Static member variables - A static variable is common to all the 
						instances (or objects) of the class 
						because it is a class level variable.
						it is also known as Class Variables.
						
7. Constructor - A constructor in Java is a special way that is used to initialize objects.
		 When an object of a class is created the constructor is called.
