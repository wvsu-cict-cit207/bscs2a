9.6.2Now let's start the search!
1. Look for a method that checks if a certain String ends with a certain suffix. For
example, if the given string is "Hello", the method should return true the suffix given
is "lo", and false if the given suffix is "alp".

Class: String
Method Declaration: Public endsWith(String suffix) 
Sample Usage:
    String Str = new String("This is really not immutable!!");
      boolean retVal;

      retVal = Str.endsWith( "immutable!!" );
      System.out.println("Returned Value = " + retVal );

      retVal = Str.endsWith( "immu" );
      System.out.println("Returned Value = " + retVal );

2. Look for the method that determines the character representation for a specific digit
in the specified radix. For example, if the input digit is 15, and the radix is 16, the
method would return the character F, since F is the hexadecimal representation for
the number 15 (base 10).

Class: Character
Method Declaration: public static char forDigit(int digit, int radix)
Sample Usage:
    char ch = Character.forDigit(10, 26);
    System.out.println(ch);

3. Look for the method that terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine

Class: Runtime
Method Declaration: public void exit(int status)
Sample Usage:
      System.out.println("Program starting...");
      Runtime.getRuntime().exit(0);
      System.out.println("Program still running...");


4. Look for the method that gets the floor of a double value. For example, if I input a
3.13, the method should return the value 3.

Class: Math
Method Declaration: public static double floor(double d)
Sample Usage:
              double d = -100.675;
              System.out.println(Math.floor(d)); 
              System.out.println(Math.ceil(d));
              
5. Look for the method that determines if a certain character is a digit. For example, if I
input '3', it returns the value true.

Class: Character
Method Declaration: public static boolean isDigit(int codePoint) 
Sample Usage: 
          System.out.println(Character.isDigit('c'));
          System.out.println(Character.isDigit('5'));
