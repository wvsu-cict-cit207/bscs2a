9.6.1

In your own, define the following terms:
1. Class - basically class acts as an object's blueprint.
It has all the information required (variables, methods,
constructors) the object should have. 

2. Object - the object is the finished product
or the output of the class that we created. 

3. Instantiate - in simple terms, it means to create a
new object using a class, or to create an instance of a 
class.

4. Instance Variable - declared inside class but not inside method

5. Instance Method - method defined in a class which is only
accessible through the object created

6. Class Variable or static member variables - they are shared, they
belong to the class not on the objects. for example, if an object
modifies a static variable, all objects of the same class are
affected.

7. Constructor - it is called when an object or instance is created
